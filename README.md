Version: 0.0.2 - Testing GUI no logic yet

# VisualSQL

A GUI made in Flutter for interacting with databases.


# Why:

I'm a visual person so the goal of this project is to create
a way to do everything one would be able to do with sql commands
without having to write actual code through an intuitive and easy to navigate GUI
